# -------------------------------- ## Intro to CS Final Project        ## Gaming Social Network [Option 1] ## -------------------------------- ### For students who have paid for the full course experience:# please check submission instructions in the Instructor Note below.# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Background# ==========# You and your friend have decided to start a company that hosts a gaming# social network site. Your friend will handle the website creation (they know # what they are doing, having taken our web development class). However, it is # up to you to create a data structure that manages the game-network information # and to define several procedures that operate on the network. ## In a website, the data is stored in a database. In our case, however, all the # information comes in a big string of text. Each pair of sentences in the text # is formatted as follows: # # <username> is connected to <name1>, <name2>,...,<nameN>. # <username> likes to play <game1>,...,<gameN>.# # Your friend records the information in that string based on user activity on # the website and gives it to you to manage. You can think of every pair of# sentences as defining a gamer profile. For example:# # John is connected to Bryant, Debra, Walter. # John likes to play The Movie: The Game, The Legend of Corgi, Dinosaur Diner.## Consider the data structures that we have used in class - lists, dictionaries,# and combinations of the two - (e.g. lists of dictionaries). Pick one which# will allow you to manage the data above and implement the procedures below. # # You can assume that <username> is a unique identifier for a user. In other# words, there is only one John in the network. Furthermore, connections are not# symmetric - if John is connected with Alice, it does not mean that Alice is# connected with John. ## Project Description# ====================# Your task is to complete the procedures according to the specifications below# as well as to implement a Make-Your-Own procedure (MYOP). You are encouraged # to define any additional helper procedures that can assist you in accomplishing # a task. You are encouraged to test your code by using print statements and the # Test Run button. # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Example string input.
